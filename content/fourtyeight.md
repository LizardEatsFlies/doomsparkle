If you are looking for a 48 hour film project team, we are in need of some roles.  You can contact us at
<a id="fourtyeight-id">2u333936383d2t2x2v2w381s2s33333137342p362z302t1a2r3331</a>.  If you do, please let us know which position
you are interested in, and if you have a demo reel, send a link along with your email.

## Who we need

**Editor**: Responsible for assembling the rough and final cuts, working
with composer, sound designer, and director to realize the film.  We would
love to have an experienced editor if possible.  Probably will do the job
of the DIT also.

**Actors**: Film actors of various levels.  We are looking for 2-3 more actors.

**Sound Designer**: Work on the non-music side of things, clean the location
audio, and prep the final mix of the dialogue tracks and any environment tracks
necessary.

**Makeup Artist**: It is a horror film, so makeup is crucial.  We'd love to
 have someone with SFX makeup experience, who can work fast, and can be part of the
 idea generation process to tell us what is and isn't feasible.

## Who we are

We are a mixure of experienced and inexperienced filmmakers who
try not to take themselves too seriously, but still work hard and try to
deliver a good film.

**Director/Producer**: Russell Hay - first-time director, and has experience as DP
 on two other 48 hour film project teams.

**Director of Photography/Producer/Writer**: Amanda Gray - first-time Cinematographer and
 has experience as director on her own short film this year.
 
**Location Sound/Producer/Writer**: Jim Bracher - Experienced filmmaker across many different
roles, veteran 48 hour film project filmmaker.

**Composer**: Crystal Jack - Electronica artist who we've worked with quite a bit in the
past on both film and non-film projects.
