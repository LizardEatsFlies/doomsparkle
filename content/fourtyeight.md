## Who we need

**Editor**: Help our film be powerful!

**Sound Designer**: Help our film sound awesome!

**Makeup Artist**: Help our actors looks beautifully scary.
 
**Actors**: Help bring our story to life.

## Who we are

We are a mixture of independent filmmakers in various stages of our
development. We believe in learning by doing, and having fun while doing
it.  We want to see how much we can do with a small screw, and spending
our budget mostly on food.
