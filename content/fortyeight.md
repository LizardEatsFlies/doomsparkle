## Who we need

**Editor**: Help our film be powerful!

**Sound Designer**: Help our film sound awesome!
 
**Actors**: Help bring our story to life!

**Make Up Artist**: Help our actors look beautiful for the camera!

## Who we are

We are a mix of independent filmmakers in various stages of our
development. We believe in learning by doing, and having fun while doing
it.  We want to see how much we can do with a small crew, and spending
our budget mostly on food.
