<h2>Principals:</h2>

<p><label class="segment">Private Eye</label> Female, 20s-40s, any race, any orientation. A tough-talking, lock-picking Seatllite with a tendency for getting into trouble and a mean right hook for getting out of it.</p>

<p><label class="segment">Homme Fatale</label> Male, 20s-30s, white or multi-racial, any orientation. A wily charmer with a chip on his shoulder, always looking out for Number one.</p>

<h2>Details:</h2>

<p><label class="segment">Content Warning</label>: There is brief stylized violence, but no guns/knives.</p>

<p><label class="segment">Compensation</label>: TBD</p>

<p><label class="segment">Filming date</label>: Saturday, 3 December 2016.</p>

<p><label class="segment">Location</label>: Very rustic cabin off I-90. If it snows, we will be hiking
in on snow shoes. There's an outhouse shared by the cabins, and another
at the nearby trailhead. Yes, it's that rustic! Due to the location,
plan for an all-day adventure. We'll be carpooling to the location from
Bellevue and Seattle.</p>

<p>VO by PRIVATE EYE will be recorded at a comfy home with all modern amenities.</p>

<p><label class="segment">Costumes/Makeup</label> dress like you're going hiking, possibly in wet snow and be camera ready</p>
