Doom Sparkle is a small collective of filmmakers who produce short
(3-5 minute) films on a regular basis in the Seattle Metro Area.
 
We formed in large 2016 as an excuse to shut up and start making films.
In December of 2016, we will be making a film every week as our first project.

If you are in the Seattle area and are interested in joining the collective,
fill out [this form](https://goo.gl/forms/jPxXzmNHN48PHt4R2).
Someone will contact you on further steps.  We have a max cap
of 10 members at any given time.
